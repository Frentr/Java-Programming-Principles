public class PlantingGrapevines {
/*    A vineyard owner is planting several new rows of grapevines and needs to know how many grapevines to plant in each
    row. She has determined that after measuring the length of a future row, she can use the following formula to
    calculate the number of vines that will fit in the row, along with the trellis end-post assemblies that will need to
    be constructed at each end of the row:

    V=Râˆ’2ES

    The terms in the formula are:
    V is the number of grapevines that will fit in the row.
    R is the length of the row, in feet.
    E is the amount of space used by an end-post assembly.
    S is the space between vines, in feet.

    Write a program that makes the calculation for the vineyard owner. The program should ask the user to input the
    following:
    - The length of the row, in feet
    - The amount of space used by an end-post assembly, in feet
    - The amount of space between the vines, in feet

    Once the input data has been entered, the program should calculate and display the number of grapevines that will
    fit in the row.*/
