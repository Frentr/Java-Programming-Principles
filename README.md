# Java Programming Principles 

### Introduction to Repository
This repository was created for my 6 week class Java Programming Principles 1 and 2 at [Southwestern College](https://ps.sckans.edu/). The book utilized for the course was [Starting Out with Java: From Control Structures through Objects, 7th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Java-Structures-Computer/dp/0134802217/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1XAZD1TWKDLH8) by [Tony Gaddis](https://www.amazon.com/Tony-Gaddis/e/B001I9Q67I/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1). This course presents Java object-oriented programming logic and fundamental techniques – from the basic concepts of primitive data types, operations, and control statements, to user defined methods, objects, classes, class inheritance and GUIs – to construct robust business solutions.

**IMPORTANT: If you are going to use any of this repo whether it be for learning, homework, or whatever please be sure to Star it on github so I can see people are utilizing this repo**
