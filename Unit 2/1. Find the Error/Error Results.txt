Question 1 
Example code :
// Warning! This code contains ERRORS!
if (x == 1);
	y = 2;
else if (x == 2) ; 
	y = 3;
else if (x == 3);
	y = 4;

Fixed Code:
if (x == 1) // Removed Semi-colon
    y = 2;
else if (x == 2) // Removed Semi-colon
    y = 3;
else if (x == 3)// Removed Semi-colon
    y = 4;

Question 2
Example code: 
// Warning! This code contains an ERROR!
if (average = 100)
   	System.out.println("Perfect average!");

Fixed Code:
if (average == 100) // Changed 'assignment' operator to 'is equal to' operator
    System.out.println("Perfect average!");

Question 3
Example Code:
// Warning! This code contains ERRORS!
if (num2 == 0)
	System.out.println("Division by zero is not possible.");
	System.out.println("Please run the program again ");
	System.out.println("and enter a number besides zero.");
else
	Quotient = num1 / num2;
	System.out.print("The quotient of " + Num1);
	System.out.print(" divided by " + Num2 + " is ");
	System.out.println(Quotient);

Fixed Code: 
if (num2 == 0)
	System.out.println("Division by zero is not possible.");
	System.out.println("Please run the program again ");
	System.out.println("and enter a number besides zero.");
else
	Quotient = num1 / num2;
	System.out.print("The quotient of " + num1); // Changed to match correct variable name 'num1' instead of 'Num1'
	System.out.print(" divided by " + num2 + " is "); // Changed to match correct variable name 'num2' instead of 'Num2'
	System.out.println(Quotient);

Question 4
Example code:
// Warning! This code contains ERRORS!
switch (score)
{
	case (score > 90):
		grade = 'A';
		break;
	case (score > 80):
		grade = 'b';
		break;
	case (score > 70):
		grade = 'C';
		break;
	case (score > 60):
		grade = 'D';
		break;
	default:
		grade = 'F';
}

Fixed Code:
switch (score)
{
    case 90: // Swapped from boolean to int
        grade = 'A';
         break;
     case 80: // Swapped from boolean to int
         grade = 'B'; // Changed to Uppercase to be uniform
         break;
     case 70: // Swapped from boolean to int
         grade = 'C';
         break;
     case 60: // Swapped from boolean to int
         grade = 'D';
         break;
     default:
         grade = 'F';
}

Question 5
Example Code:
if (!x > 20)

Fixed Code:
if (x <= 20) // Removed incorrect logic statement and added less than or equal to

Question 6.
Example Code:
if (count >= 0 || count <= 100)

Fixed Code:
if (count >= 0 && count <= 100) // Changed OR logic operator to AND logic operator

Question 7:
Example code:
if  (count < 0 && count > 100)

Fixed Code:
if (count > 0 && count < 100) // swapped less than and greater than operators to ensure statement checks if count is between 0 and 100

Question 8:
Example Code:
z = (a < 10) : 0 ? 7;

Fixed code:
z = (a < 10) ? 0 : 7; // Moved conditional operator to correct position in statement

Question 9
Example Code:
if (partNumber.equals("BQ789W4"))
	available = true;

Fixed Code:
if (partNumber.equalsIgnoreCase("BQ789W4")) // Changed to a case-insensitive comparison
    available = true;

Question 10
Example Code: 
double value = 12345.678;
System.out.printf("%.2d", value);

Fixed Code:
double value = 12345.678;
System.out.printf("%.2f", value); // Changed d to f as f deals with float or double variables. d deals with int, short, and long data types.
