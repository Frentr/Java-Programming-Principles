 This program was written by Kyle Martin on 8/7/2021 for Java Programming Principles 2 during Summer Session 2
 at Southwestern College, Kansas.
 
 IMPORTANT: Normally I would not place a bunch of comments in my code describing what my code is doing as I like to
 have code that is written in a manner to be understandable while reading it. Though, do to the grading rubric I will
 explain my code.
 
 This program was created to fix sudo code.
