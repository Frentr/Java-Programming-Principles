 * This program was written by Kyle Martin on 7/22/2021 for Java Programming Principles 2 during Summer Session 2
 * at Southwestern College, Kansas.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Normally I would not place a bunch of comments in my code describing what my code is doing as I like to
 * have code that is written in a manner to be understandable while reading it. Though, do to the grading rubric I will
 * explain my code.
 *
 * This program was created to fix a error in sudo code
 * See Chapter 12 Find the Error Question 1.
