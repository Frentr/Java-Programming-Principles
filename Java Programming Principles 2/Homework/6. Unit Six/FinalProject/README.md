# Computer Configuration Customizer
### Requirements:
For this project, we were task to create a Java GUI program where the user can choose between ordering an Intel or AMD computer with extra options for choosing which CPU, Memory, Storage, Graphics Card, Optical Drive, Operating System, and Additional Software packages the user would like to upgrade to. We had to create a system that would update the sub-total price of the computer on the fly, the ability to start over, and a calculate order system which included adding tax and shipping to the cost.
